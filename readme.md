# Naive Web ML App

This is a very naive implementation of a web ML app. It uses a model I trained as a part of the "Deep Learning for Coders with fastai and PyTorch" course by fastai. I say it's naive because there is no rate-limiting or queue system so it wouldn't be suitable as a real product, but it is an implementation of machine learning into a web application. The model is a fined-tuned version of resnet34 specialized in detecting whether an image contains a grizzly bear, a black bear, or a teddy bear. 50 examples of each type of bear were automatically pulled from duckduckgo for a total of 150. Manually, mislabled images or images not containing real life bears (such as cartoon versions) were replaced. Of that 150, 100 were randomly put into the training set, 30 were randomly put into the validation set, and 20 were used for the test set. In the end, an error rate of exactly 0% was acheived on the validation and test sets. Because the search results are generally very clear and artistic, were this model to be deployed in say, a public park, it would likely not be nearly as effective.
